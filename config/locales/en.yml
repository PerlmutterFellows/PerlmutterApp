      question: "What is The Land of a Thousand Hills?"
      answer: "In our experience, we have found that most clients do not have the foundational skills needed to keep a job. They do not have the problem-solving and communication skills to successfully deal with co-workers because of a myriad of issues related to their unstable housing situation. To address this, in 2016, we opened our social enterprise, The Land of a Thousand Hills – Lynn. This social enterprise provides a venue for job-training and operating funds for all of our programs.  Our café is award-winning, having received the prestigious BONS (Best of North Shore) for Best Coffee Shop in the categories of Readers and Editor’s choice for the past three years (2017, 2018, & 2019)!"

      question: "What can I expect on my first visit?"
      answer: "You’ll meet with one of our case managers who will ask you some questions to try to understand your situation (try to bring whatever IDs and documents you can to help us with this process), enjoy a meal and some snacks, get some groceries and hygiene supplies to take with you, set some basic goals with one of our case managers, check out recent postings for available jobs and housing options in the area, begin accomplishing some of the goals with the help of one of our case managers, and get a free gift card for food or coffee on your way out!"
