# Perlmutter App
An application developed to help not for profits maintain communication with constituents in the post-pandemic environment.

Organizations can send events, information, and messages as admins to users via call, text, email, or in-app newsletter, whichever contact method(s) each constituent has access to or would want to use.

Organizations can download this repository and run the organization initializer to configure their app and deploy a customized app for their organization's needs.

Our initial client in developing the app is [The Haven Project](https://havenproject.net/), an impactful organization started to address a gap in services to unaccompanied homeless young adults and surrounding communities. They provide direct service to more than 200 homeless unaccompanied youth ages 17-24 each year in their Drop-in Centers, with referrals to other youth serving organizations for hundreds more who donâ€™t meet intake criteria.

## Hosting Services/Costs
The Perlmutter App relies on a few services to function, which may incur costs. It is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and it uses [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to provision and automate a phone number to call/text users from.

Heroku is free by default, but can upgrade your app's performance with increased tiers.

Twilio costs, [according to their pricing in August 2020](https://www.twilio.com/pricing), $1.00/month for the phone number powering the app, $0.0085/min to receive and $0.013/min to make calls, and $0.0075 to receive and make texts.

These services are all provisioned via the initializer with your user input, to help simplify the process for you!
