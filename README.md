# Perlmutter App
An application developed to help not for profits maintain communication with constituents in the post-pandemic environment.

Organizations can send events, information, and messages as admins to users via call, text, email, or in-app newsletter.

Our primary client is [The Haven Project](https://havenproject.net/), an impactful organization started to address a gap in services to unaccompanied homeless young adults and surrounding communities.
They provide direct service to more than 200 homeless unaccompanied youth ages 17-24 each year in their Drop-in Centers, with referrals to other youth serving organizations for hundreds more who donâ€™t meet intake criteria.
